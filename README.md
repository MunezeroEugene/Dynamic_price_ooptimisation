## 🔍 Sample Results

### Customer Segments
```
Champions (28.5%): High-value, loyal customers
├── Avg Recency: 45 days
├── Avg Frequency: 8.2 orders  
├── Avg Monetary: £892
└── Strategy: Premium Pricing (+10%)

Loyal Customers (25.1%): Regular, reliable buyers
├── Avg Recency: 67 days
├── Avg Frequency: 5.4 orders
├── Avg Monetary: £445  
└── Strategy: Value Pricing (+5%)
```

### Price Elasticity
```
Budget Products (£0-2): High elasticity (1.8) → Volume strategy
Economy Products (£2-5): Moderate elasticity (1.2) → Competitive strategy  
Premium Products (£10+): Low elasticity (0.4) → Margin optimization
```
